They were poor; they didn't have the necessary resources, but the husband worked so hard because his wife had had an accident. It happened one day that his wife was working on a campaign for the conservation of endangered animals. She went to a place in search of animals.

Her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy, the wife of the man, on the floor. They asked her if she was OK, but she didn't answer, so her partner took her to the doctor. There, the doctor said that she was OK but she would never hear again unless she paid 1, 000 dollars for an operation.","feedback":"The verb 'attack' is in the present tense, but the context of the story is in the past.
