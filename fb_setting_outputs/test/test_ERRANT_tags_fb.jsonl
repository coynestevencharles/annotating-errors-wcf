The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >).

These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a deleted word.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into. Use this to guide the overall angle of your feedback. You are not obligated to use the name of the error_tag in your feedback. It is there to help you understand the nature of the error.

We already plan to present examples alongside the feedback comments, which will be prepared separately.\n- Typically, the explanation should not include an edit suggestion, and the edit suggestion should not explain the error in too much detail.\n- The content in each field must be sufficiently independent since the possibility exists that only one of the two would be shown.\n- Assuming both fields are shown, the resulting concatenated comment should be coherent and not overly redundant.\n- Avoid praise for the learner for trying, or for correct English elsewhere in the text.\n- Avoid speculation or commentary about the learner's first language, nationality, or what they are trying to do with the text.\n- Be careful with the second person, and avoid uncouched language such as \"you are thinking of\u2026\" - If second person is appropriate, words like \"may\" should be considered.\n- IMPORTANT: Do not refer to [NONE], the asterisks, or the angle brackets in your feedback.
