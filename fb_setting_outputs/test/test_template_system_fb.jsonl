When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why.

Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}.

Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted.

It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback.

Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces.

Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback.

These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}.

Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >).

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\". All fields should be fully rendered.

Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback.

These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces.

Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.", "user": "Consider the Task Examples below and provide feedback for the Current

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why.

Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces.

Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any.

The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >).

Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback.

Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.", "user": "Consider the Task Examples below and provide feedback for the Current

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".
