You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.", "user": "Consider the Task Examples below and provide feedback for the Current

Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any.

Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback.

Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}.

Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks.

The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >).

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.", "user": "Consider the Task Examples below and provide feedback for the Current

The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error.

Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any.

An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any.

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\".

',\nerror_tag: Vocabulary Choice", "error_tag_used": "Vocabulary Choice", "input_prompt": {"system": "# Task Introduction\n\nWrite feedback for a language error made by a learner of English using the provided templates. You will be provided with the learner's original (source) sentence and a version with one single error corrected. Select one comment template from the candidates and use the selected template to construct an accurate, informative, and fluent feedback comment. When filling in a template, be conservative and do not add content beyond the fields defined in the template.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe input will consist of the following\n\n- \"source\": The learner's sentence with a single error marked for consideration. The exact words that must change are marked with asterisks. These are called \"error_word(s)\". A potentially broader span highlighting the error is also marked with angle brackets (< and >). If [NONE] is present, it indicates a missing word.\n- \"corrected\": A corrected version of the sentence with changes applied. The exact words that changed are marked with asterisks. These are called \"suggested_word(s)\". If [NONE] is present, it indicates a word that was deleted from the source sentence.\n- \"error_type\": A category that the error has been classified into.\n- \"template_candidates\": One or more templates for feedback. Your task is to select and fill one of these, unless there are no appropriate options.\n\nEach template candidate has the following fields:\n\n- \"template_id\": A unique string identifying the template.\n- \"template_description\": A short description or summary of what the template is designed to address.\n- \"template_explanation\": The first half of a feedback comment, focusing on what is wrong and why. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n- \"template_suggestion\": The latter half of a feedback comment, focusing on what to do to fix the error. It may have fillable fields, detailed below.\n\n### Template Fields\n\nThe templates have fields with curly braces. Anything not in curly braces should be left as-is.\n\n- {error_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that must be edited.\n- {suggested_word(s)} - Words that would be added or changed in the corrected sentence if the feedback were followed.\n- {context_word(s)} - Words in the learner's sentence that do not have to be revised but can help with an explanation. These may also be used as reference points to indicate where an insertion or edit must be made.\n- {alternative 1 || alternative 2} - Specific words can be listed as alternatives, e.g., {a || an} for when an indefinite article needs to be added, but which one to use would not be clear until resolving the template. Pipes are the mark of this kind of field. IMPORTANT: The filled content must precisely match one of the options separated by pipes.\n- Other potential fields, always enclosed with curly braces. Do your best to interpret these in context, and always fill bracketed sections. Examples include {subject} or {optional_article}. Anything with \"optional\" can be omitted when filled in if the context is appropriate.\n- In complex cases, fields may be nested, generally with alternatives in which each option contains its own field(s). Make sure to resolve these carefully so that only one option is selected and all its internal fields are filled.\n\nTemplate fields can have additional extensions such as \"_definition\" or \"_part_of_speech\". Do your best to interpret these and apply them accurately.\n\n### Notes on Filling Template Fields\n\n- If a field is at the start of a sentence, the first letter of the filled content should be capitalized.\n- When filling fields, respect nearby quotes, parentheses, and so on.\n- When filling {error_word(s)}, fill with the exact words in the learner sentence, which may be misspelled or incorrect.\n- If {error_word(s)} or {suggested_word(s)} refer to punctuation marks, they can be talked about indirectly instead of directly quoted. Thus, it is better to say e.g., \"remove the comma\" instead of \"remove ','\".\n- Finally, note that \"[NONE]\" must NEVER be filled into a template field. An output like \"Change 'the' to '[NONE]'\" is invalid. Such an edit must be written as e.g., \"Remove 'the.'\" It is better to select a different template or None if filling with \"[NONE]\" is the only option.\n\n## Output Format\n\nYour final response should consist of three outputs in a JSON object:\n\n- \"selected_template\": The template_id of the most appropriate template, if any. A \"None\" template is a valid option when no candidate seems appropriate. If \"None\" is selected, all other outputs should be blank strings.\n- \"feedback_explanation\": A filled version of the template's \"template_explanation\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.\n- \"feedback_suggestion\": A filled version of the template's \"template_suggestion\". All fields should be fully rendered. MUST NOT contain any instances of \"[NONE]\", \"{\", \"}\", \"*\", \"||\", or other template-specific symbols.", "user": "Consider the Task Examples below and provide feedback for the Current Input.\n\n## Task Examples\n\n### Example 1\n\nExample 1 Input:\n\nsource: The responsibility of <*the* educational institutions> is to make sure that he/she won't be in danger in the swimming pool instead of dissuading him/her from getting close to the water.\ncorrected: The responsibility of *[NONE]* educational institutions is to make sure that he/she won't be in danger in the swimming pool instead of dissuading him/her from getting close to the water.\nerror_tag: Missing/Unnecessary Article\n\ntemplate_candidates:\n\ntemplate_id: Missing/Unnecessary Article_00\ntemplate_description: Missing article\ntemplate_explanation: You need an article before {context_word(s)}.\" \"{context_word(s)}\" {is || is not} specific, so it should use {a || an} {definite || indefinite} article.\ntemplate_suggestion: Add \"{suggested_word}\" before {context_word(s)}.\n\ntemplate_id: Missing/Unnecessary Article_01\ntemplate_description: Article with abstract or uncountable noun\ntemplate_explanation: \"{context_word(s)}\" is an {abstract || uncountable} noun, so it does not need an article here.\ntemplate_suggestion: Remove the article \"{error_word}.\"\n\ntemplate_id: Missing/Unnecessary Article_02\ntemplate_description: Article in illegal determiner combination\ntemplate_explanation: Articles like \"{error_word}\" can not be combined with {context_word(s)_type} like \"{context_word(s)}.\"\ntemplate_suggestion: Remove \"{error_word}\" to correct the sentence.\n\ntemplate_id: Missing/Unnecessary Article_03\ntemplate_description: \"The\" used with general plural\ntemplate_explanation: The article \"the\" is not necessary because you are talking about {context_word(s)} in general.\ntemplate_suggestion: Remove the article \"the.\"\n\ntemplate_id: None\ntemplate_description: Select this when none of the above templates are appropriate for this error, none can be filled properly, or when there are no other templates listed.\ntemplate_explanation: ''\ntemplate_suggestion: ''\n\nExample 1 Output:\n\nselected_template: Missing/Unnecessary Article_03\nfeedback_explanation: The article \"the\" is not necessary because you are talking about educational institutions in general.\nfeedback_suggestion: Remove the article \"the.\"\n\n### Example 2\n\nExample 2 Input:\n\nsource: That is why I totally agree with Richardson's modality dealing with this important issue which is present in students', schools' and <parents *[NONE]* lives> nowadays.\ncorrected: That is why I totally agree with Richardson's modality dealing with this important issue which is present in students', schools' and parents *'* lives nowadays.\nerror_tag: Possessive\n\ntemplate_candidates:\n\ntemplate_id: Possessive_00\ntemplate_description: Missing Possessive\ntemplate_explanation: When something belongs to something else, it is necessary to use a possessive.\ntemplate_suggestion: Change \"{error_word(s)}\" to a possessive form to show {who || what} the {context_word(s)} belong{s} to.\n\ntemplate_id: Possessive_01\ntemplate_description: Misplaced apostrophe (should be singular 's)\ntemplate_explanation: The possessive of a singular noun like \"{error_word(s)}\" is formed by adding an apostrophe + s.\ntemplate_suggestion: Move the apostrophe before the s to fix this possessive.\n\ntemplate_id: Possessive_02\ntemplate_description: Misplaced Apostrophe (should be plural s')\ntemplate_explanation: It seems this should be a plural possessive, but an apostrophe + s ending is only used for the singular of \"{error_word(s)}.\"\ntemplate_suggestion: To make this a plural possessive, move the apostrophe to the end of the word, after the s.\n\ntemplate_id: Possessive_03\ntemplate_description: Part of Whole with \"of\"\ntemplate_explanation: When one thing is a part of something else, the preposition \"of\" is typically used to show the relationship.\ntemplate_suggestion: {Add \"of\" after \"{context_word(s)}.\" || Change \"{error_word(s)}\" to \"of.\"}\n\ntemplate_id: Possessive_04\ntemplate_description: Genitive/Associative \"of\"\ntemplate_explanation: \"{error_word(s)}\" is not the right preposition to show what is associated with \"{context_word(s)}.\"\ntemplate_suggestion: Change \"{error_word(s)}\" to \"of.\"\n\ntemplate_id: None\ntemplate_description: Select this when none of the above templates are appropriate for this error, none can be filled properly, or when there are no other templates listed.\ntemplate_explanation: ''\ntemplate_suggestion: ''\n\nExample 2 Output:\n\nselected_template: Possessive_00\nfeedback_explanation: When something belongs to something else, it is necessary to use a possessive.\nfeedback_suggestion: Change \"parents\" to a possessive form to show who the lives belong to.\n\n## Current Input\n\nsource: You <*lost* your flight> and it was a business trip!
